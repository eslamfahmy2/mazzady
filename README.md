# Project Structure

The project uses a MVVM architecture. The app is primarily backend driven and can only function when
the user has an internet connection. There is no local database, as the needed data is retrieved
fresh from the backend. Business logic and use cases are placed in a separate Repository layer.
View Models are used to communicate with the UI layer, which is primarily written with the Compose
framework.

package and is subdivided into packages according to view
".domain" package contains systems models , repositories, mappers..
